# A Password Generator Website is a secure online tool designed to create strong, random passwords for users.
It typically offers various customization options, allowing users to specify password length, complexity (including numbers, symbols, and uppercase/lowercase letters), and other criteria to enhance security.
The generated passwords help protect user accounts from unauthorized access, making it easier to maintain online safety. Many password generators also emphasize user privacy by not storing or sharing generated passwords.
